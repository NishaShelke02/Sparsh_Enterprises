This ensures every drop of milk is pure, nutrient-rich, and full of natural goodness.\n________________________________________\n\nü•õ Our Process\nWe follow ethical milking practices ‚Äì our calves always receive their rightful share of milk before we collect the rest. This balance nurtures both the cow and calf, keeping the cycle of nature intact.\nOur ghee is then prepared in small batches using the traditional Bilona method:\n‚Ä¢ Fresh milk is set into curd\n‚Ä¢ Curd is hand-churned in wooden vessels\n‚Ä¢ Butter is simmered slowly on low flame\nThis process preserves the golden essence, grainy texture, rich aroma, and vital nutrients of our Gir Cow A2 Ghee.\n________________________________________\n\nü§ù Our Promise\n‚Ä¢ 100% farm-to-home purity\n‚Ä¢ Ethical & cruelty-free dairy practices\n‚Ä¢ Naturally fed Gir cows, free from hormones & antibiotics\n‚Ä¢ Traditional craftsmanship with modern hygiene standards\n‚Ä¢ Eco-friendly packaging for sustainable living\n________________________________________\n\n‚ú® When you choose our Gir Cow A2 Ghee, you‚Äôre not just choosing a product‚Äîyou‚Äôre embracing a lifestyle of purity, tradition, and holistic wellness."
